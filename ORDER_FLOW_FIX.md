# Order Creation Flow Fix

## âœ… Issue Fixed: Flow Breaking After Approval

The problem was that after token approval, the user interface wasn't clearly guiding users to the next step (order creation).

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

### 1. **Improved Step Flow**
- Added new `'approved'` step between approval and order creation
- Users now get clear confirmation when approval is successful
- Manual "Create Order Now" button appears after approval

### 2. **Better User Experience**
- **Before**: After approval, UI showed "Creating order..." but nothing happened
- **After**: Clear success message + explicit button to proceed

### 3. **Step Indicator Updates**
- Updated step indicator to show approval â†’ create flow clearly
- Visual feedback shows when approval is complete

### 4. **Removed Automatic Flow**
- **Before**: Tried to automatically proceed to order creation (failed)
- **After**: User manually clicks "Create Order Now" after approval success

## ðŸŽ¯ New Flow

1. **Fill Form** â†’ Click "Approve Token"
2. **Approval Transaction** â†’ MetaMask prompt for token approval
3. **Approval Success** â†’ Green checkmark + "Create Order Now" button
